"# IBSCMasterFeedbackDash" 

This Dashboard is designed to give the skeleton framework for individual school feedback dashboards for the International Boys School Coalition Phase 2 Project.

To install any missing packages, uncomment and run the first part of packageSetup.R.

masterDash.RMD requires the requisite .RDS files from the working directory.  To generate these, download the .xlsx data from the requisite Polinode surveys to the working directory and run setup.R.  Then run dashMaster.RMD and quality review.  Finally publish to shinyApps.io, adding each .RDS file, either to masterDash.RMD YAML header, or via gui to shinyApps.io.
