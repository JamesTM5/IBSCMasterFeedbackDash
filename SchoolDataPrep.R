#This script takes data output from Polinode, and processes it for use in the
#IBSC Class dashboard.  To use, put the .xlsx output from all the surveys for a
#given school from polinode into the working directory and then run the script.
#The output will generate in the working directory the .RDS Files needed by the
#dashboard. The .xlsx and this file do not need to be published to shinyApps.io
