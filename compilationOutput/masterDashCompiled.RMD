### Our Commentary



  The data shown here is a result of analysis conducted upon the social

network data provided by completing our Relationships Foundation

Questionnaires, along with any other information provided to us by you

and/or `r fileList[[2]]$clientName`.



  Our analysis shows this class to be moderately healthy and with a moderate potential for improvement.

> The higher the overall degree score, the more tied in the person is to the class.  Those learners who score nearest the average are those who are best placed to develop resiliency in the relational network of the class when they are encouraged to relate to one another, because they have connections to bring to bear, and have relational overhead to be able to develop further relationships without others suffering from divided attention.

```{r}

renderPlotly ({
