### Interaction Positivity

#### 'Interaction Positivity' Degree All Scores

#### 'Interaction Positivity' Degree In Scores

```{r}
renderPlotly ({
  fileList[[1]]$degreeInHistogramList[[1]]
})
```

> A higher 'Degree in' score indicates that more people in the class come
to this person for information
